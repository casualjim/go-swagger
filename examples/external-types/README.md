# External types examples

The sample specification provided here demonstrates how to bind your generated API
with some externally defined types for schemas.

The swagger specification illustrates the following use cases:

1. refer to an external type imported from some external package
2. refer to an external type imported from the default location of models (i.e. besides generated models)
3. embed external type to add the Validatable interface.
4. use hints in annotations to solve nullable/struct vs interface issues 
5. use hints in annotations to skip the validation of external types
