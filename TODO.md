[ ] empty string in param name passes validation: generates wrong code ("Empty" is ok, but other stuff breaks)
[ ] duplicate key in json (e.g. parameters) passes validation
[ ] example "todos" with duplicate "parameters" key fails to expand correctly
[ ] initialism kept in operationID? e.g. "DELETE_todo"
